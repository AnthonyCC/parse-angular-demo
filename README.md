# A boilerplate for AngularJS x Backbone.js x Parse apps


An opinionated, battle-tested boilerplate for building large, powerful, serverless apps with AngularJS, Backbone and Parse.

Built by guys who would rather be coding than [shopping](http://www.getbrandid.com)

### Why we made this


We love [Parse](http://parse.com), Backbone.js and AngularJS. We hate servers.

Whilst building [BRANDiD](http://www.getbrandid.com) we developed some best practices around this stack, so we decided to open source it here. We even talked about it on the [Parse Blog](http://blog.parse.com).

This boilerplate is great for launching complex database enabled apps really fast. Let us know what we can improve via twitter [@spacenick](http://www.twitter.com/spacenick) and [@arush](http://www.twitter.com/arush)!
